# COVID-19-Vaccine-Allocation-Under-the-Coordination-of-Public-Health-Organizations
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
**Program descriptionï¼š**
1. The main program contains the code that solves the myopic decision and conducts the simulation of the epidemic spreading process
2. fun_allocation_phase is the code that iterates during the myopic strategy solving process
3. fun_allocation_phase is the code that simulates the spreading process during the period between the end of vaccine distribution and the end of the epidemic.
4. Initialization omitted for simplicity and ease of understanding
